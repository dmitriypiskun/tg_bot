# Telegram bot

The project consists of two parts:

- API
- Client

For local launch, you need to follow the steps described in each project. You will also need to follow additional steps:

1. Register the bot in Telegram;
2. Deploy the client on the cloud server since the Telegram bot cannot refer to the local address of the computer.
